			<div style="text-align: left;">
			<p class="description limitWidth">Hello everyone!</p>
			<p class="description limitWidth">I sincerely appreciate you being a part of this year's SCMUN. This year's SCMUN is brought to you by some of the most amazing and passionate individuals. Everything you see has come solely from the hard work of the SCMUN leadership team which is one hundred percent student-led.</p>
			<p class="description limitWidth">I believe that Model United Nations is a necessity in our world. Peace has never been easy and while at times it seems as though that it is nonexistent, it truly is closer than it has ever been in human history. Because of people like you, solutions are being created, changes are being made, and with each new conversation that is had, justice is even closer to billions than ever before. You are gathered here because you believe in something far greater than yourself. You believe that by coming together and discussing differences with each other, you can create an environment that ensures justice for all.</p>
			<p class="description limitWidth">While it seems that every MUN conference is simply "talking", and "negotiating", and "waiting for two days to end", you must understand that these are the same thoughts of our world leaders. They meet together and put a smile on their face and shake hands, and "talk" and "negotiate" and then at the end of the two days, leave. At that end, they have two choices, they can choose to make a change, or they can let it be a fleeting memory. I urge you, take this conference and every conference as an opportunity to grow, and make a choice with what you have done.</p>
			<p class="description limitWidth">As my favorite political figure of all time once said, "If civilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science of human relationship-the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live together, in the same world at peace."</p>
			<p class="description limitWidth" style="text-align: right;">Sincerely,</p>
			<p class="description limitWidth" style="text-align: right;">Nathaniel Cooper</p>
